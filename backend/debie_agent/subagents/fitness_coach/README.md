# Fitness Coach Agent for Debie Diabetes Management Platform

## Overview
The Fitness Coach Agent is a specialized AI component of the Debie Diabetes Management Platform that provides comprehensive exercise guidance optimized for diabetes management. It helps users implement safe, effective exercise routines that contribute to better glucose management while considering individual fitness levels and preferences.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Personalized Exercise Planning
Creates customized exercise routines considering multiple factors:
- User's fitness level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Exercise preferences and interests
- Diabetes type and associated risks
- Historical glucose data and exercise response
- Equipment availability and accessibility

### 2. Google Calendar Integration
Full integration with Google Calendar to help users implement and maintain exercise routines:
- Creates workout events with appropriate duration and descriptions
- Schedules pre and post-exercise glucose check reminders
- Sets up logging reminders after workouts to track completion
- Uses color-coding for different event types (workouts, checks, reminders)
- Implements recurring events to establish exercise habits

### 3. Exercise Instructions and Guidance
Provides detailed guidance for executing workout plans safely:
- Step-by-step exercise instructions with visual guides
- Difficulty modifications for different fitness levels
- Equipment alternatives for home workouts
- Warm-up and cool-down recommendations
- Safety considerations specific to diabetes

### 4. Glucose Management Around Exercise
Delivers specialized recommendations for managing glucose before, during, and after workouts:
- Pre-exercise glucose targets and medication adjustments
- During-exercise monitoring guidelines and carbohydrate needs
- Post-exercise glucose tracking for delayed hypoglycemia
- Specific considerations for different exercise types and intensities
- Emergency preparation for hypoglycemic events

### 5. Exercise Nutrition Planning
Suggests optimal nutrition strategies to support workouts with diabetes considerations:
- Pre-workout meal/snack timing and composition
- During-workout fueling for longer sessions
- Post-workout recovery nutrition
- Adaptations for dietary preferences and restrictions
- Strategies to minimize glucose fluctuations

### 6. Exercise Impact Analysis
Analyzes the relationship between exercise and glucose levels to improve recommendations:
- Identifies optimal exercise types for glucose management
- Determines ideal exercise timing relative to meals
- Evaluates duration and intensity effects on glucose
- Recognizes individual patterns and responses
- Recommends adjustments to maximize benefits and minimize risks

## Technical Implementation
- Built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Powered by Gemini 2.0 Pro for accurate exercise and diabetes guidance
- Includes specialized tools for each functional area
- Uses typed parameters and return values for robust data handling
- Integrates with the broader Debie platform and other subagents

## Google Calendar Integration Components
The Fitness Coach Agent's calendar functionality is implemented through three primary calendar integration functions:

1. **create_workout_events**: Creates calendar events for each workout in the exercise plan, including:
   - Exercise type, duration, and intensity details in the description
   - Appropriate color-coding for easy identification
   - Scheduled recurring events for habit formation
   - Diabetes management tips embedded in event descriptions

2. **create_exercise_logging_reminders**: Creates follow-up reminders after each workout:
   - Timed to appear shortly after the scheduled workout end
   - Prompts for logging duration, intensity, and physiological response
   - Links back to the original workout event
   - Provides data collection fields for continuous improvement

3. **schedule_glucose_checks**: Creates glucose monitoring reminders around exercise:
   - Pre-exercise checks with target ranges and action recommendations
   - Post-exercise immediate checks to assess workout impact
   - Delayed checks for longer/intense workouts to monitor for late hypoglycemia
   - Specific guidance tailored to the workout type and intensity

## Usage
The Fitness Coach Agent is accessed from the main Debie Agent when user queries involve exercise planning, workout guidance, or activity-related glucose management. It processes relevant user data and either provides conversation-based guidance or creates actionable calendar events to support the user's fitness goals.

## Data Requirements
For optimal performance, the Fitness Coach Agent benefits from:
- Basic user information (age, weight, height, gender)
- Diabetes type and treatment approach
- Fitness level and exercise preferences
- Exercise history (if available)
- Glucose readings before and after exercise sessions
- Any exercise-related concerns or limitations

## Privacy and Security
All exercise planning and calendar integration occurs within the secure Debie environment with appropriate data protection measures. Calendar events are created only with explicit user permission, and all health data is handled according to HIPAA guidelines.
