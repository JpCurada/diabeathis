# Health Analyst Agent for Debie Diabetes Management Platform

## Overview
The Health Analyst Agent is a specialized AI component of the Debie Diabetes Management Platform that processes and analyzes user health data to provide meaningful insights about diabetes management. It serves as the primary analytical engine for identifying trends, patterns, and correlations in diabetes-related data.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Comprehensive Health Reports
Generates detailed health reports based on all available user data, including glucose readings, medication logs, food intake, and exercise activity. Reports include metrics, insights, and actionable recommendations tailored to the user's specific diabetes management needs.

### 2. Glucose Pattern Analysis
Performs advanced statistical analysis of glucose readings to identify daily and weekly patterns, meal response trends, and anomalies. Provides detailed risk assessments for hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia with prevention suggestions.

### 3. Correlation Analysis
Examines relationships between various factors (food, medication, exercise, sleep) and glucose levels with statistical confidence measurements. Identifies primary and secondary correlations, time-lag effects, and provides evidence-based causal assessments.

### 4. Logging Gap Identification
Analyzes the consistency and completeness of user data logging to identify gaps and suggest calendar-based solutions. Provides detailed breakdowns of logging behavior across different data categories (glucose, food, medication, exercise) with concrete improvement strategies.

### 5. Glucose Trend Forecasting
Predicts future glucose trends based on historical patterns and upcoming calendar events. Identifies high-risk situations and provides preventative strategies integrated with the calendar system.

### 6. A1C Trajectory Assessment
Estimates current A1C levels based on glucose data and projects future A1C trends. Delivers targeted improvement strategies with specific calendar implementation plans.

## Google Calendar Integration
The Health Analyst Agent is deeply integrated with Google Calendar to help users implement recommendations and improve diabetes management:

- Creates suggested calendar events for glucose monitoring, medication adjustments, and exercise sessions
- Recommends optimal timing for health-related activities based on identified patterns
- Designs notification strategies with varying priorities and confirmation requirements
- Enables habit formation through structured calendar-based routines

## Technical Design
- Implemented using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- Leverages Gemini 2.0 Pro for advanced analytics and natural language capabilities
- Includes specialized tools for each analytical function
- Uses a stateful context-aware approach to maintain user context across interactions
- Integrates with the broader Debie platform through standardized data structures and state management

## Usage
The Health Analyst Agent is accessed from the main Debie Agent when user queries require detailed health analysis. It processes relevant user data and returns structured insights that can be presented to the user in a conversational manner or translated into actionable calendar events.

## Data Requirements
For optimal performance, the Health Analyst Agent requires:
- Glucose readings with timestamps (ideally 3+ readings per day)
- Medication logs with medication types and dosages
- Food logs with carbohydrate content and meal timing
- Exercise logs with duration and intensity information
- Optional sleep data to enhance correlation analysis

## Privacy and Security
All analysis is performed within the secure Debie environment with appropriate data protection measures. Insights are stored in the user's personal data space and are not shared externally unless explicitly authorized by the user.
