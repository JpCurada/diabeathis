## üåü The Problem

Diabetes affects over 537 million adults globally, with numbers projected to rise to 783 million by 2045. In the Philippines alone, approximately 4 million adults live with diabetes, and an estimated 1.8 million remain undiagnosed. Managing diabetes requires constant attention to multiple factors:

- Blood glucose monitoring
- Medication adherence
- Dietary management
- Physical activity tracking
- Healthcare appointments

The fragmented nature of diabetes care tools forces patients to juggle multiple apps and systems, leading to poor adherence, missed interventions, and deteriorating health outcomes.

### What if we could lessen the impact of diabetes in the Philippines by giving everyone personalized support **to manage it better**?

## üí° Our Solution

DiaBeatThis is a comprehensive diabetes management platform powered by AI agents that provides personalized, integrated support for diabetes care. The platform consolidates all aspects of diabetes management into a single, intelligent system that adapts to each user's unique health profile and lifestyle.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Development Status:** The frontend application and integration with the Debie Agent system are currently under active development. Some features may be incomplete or subject to change.
